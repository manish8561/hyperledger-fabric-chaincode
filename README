Very similarly, we have the GetAllAssets and ReadAsset functions.

let result = await contract.evaluateTransaction('GetAllAssets'); 
// ... 
let result = await contract.evaluateTransaction('ReadAsset', asset); 
// ...
let result = await contract.submitTransaction('CreateAsset', 
                                'asset101', 
                                'violet', 
                                '5', 
                                'Snnorre 3', 
                                '1300'); 
The file also has some code fragments that allow passing comments into the code. So, we can call it using the following commands.

node ledgerActions.js GetAllAssets 
node ledgerActions.js ReadAsset asset1 
node ledgerActions.js CreateAsset
